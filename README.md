# Core Computer Science Compendium 🗺️

> "Computer science is a universe written in bits and logic. This repository is my personal atlas, charting a course through its fundamental continents—from the intricate coastlines of Algorithms to the vast plains of Operating Systems. Each file is a landmark, a discovery on a journey to map the digital world."

## The Cartographer's Philosophy

This repository is more than just a collection of notes; it's a structured learning project built on a few core principles:

* 🌱 **Daily Incremental Growth:** Knowledge is built brick by brick. This repository is updated daily with my progress, no matter how small. This reflects a real, consistent learning journey.
* 🧠 **Clarity Through Visualization:** Complex topics are best understood visually. Wherever possible, concepts are explained with custom-made diagrams and flowcharts to make the abstract tangible.
* 💻 **Theory Grounded in Practice:** Every major theoretical concept is accompanied by clean, well-commented code snippets and a section on its real-world applications.

## Navigating the Repository

This repository is updated daily. To keep the notes organized, each topic folder (e.g., `01-Arrays-in-C`) will contain multiple files, named by date and part number.

For any given topic, you will find a series of files like this:

1.  **`YYYY-MM-DD_Topic_Part1.md`**: The primary, typed notes for a specific day's study session.
2.  **`YYYY-MM-DD_Topic_Part1_HandWritten.pdf`**: The corresponding scanned PDF of my raw, handwritten notes for that session.

This structure allows you to follow my progress day-by-day. To read a topic from start to finish, simply sort the files by name.

### **Master Index Files**

To make navigation even easier, each major subject folder (like `C-Programming-Fundamentals/`) will contain a master index file named `_Table_of_Contents.md`. This file provides a structured list of all topics and direct links to the note files in the correct chronological order. **Always start with the index file to get a clear overview.**
