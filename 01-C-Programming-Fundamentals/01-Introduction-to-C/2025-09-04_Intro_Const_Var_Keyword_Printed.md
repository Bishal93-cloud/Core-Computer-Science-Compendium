### INTRODUCTION

[cite_start]Four important aspects of any programming language are[cite: 2, 3, 5]:
1.  [cite_start]The way it stores data [cite: 4, 6]
2.  [cite_start]The way it operates upon this data [cite: 7, 8, 9]
3.  How it accomplishes input and output
4.  [cite_start]How it lets us control the sequence of execution of instructions in a program [cite: 10, 11, 12, 18]

### WHAT IS C?

[cite_start]C is a programming language developed at AT&T's Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie[cite: 14, 19, 20]. [cite_start]C became popular because it is simple and easy to use[cite: 21, 22, 23, 24].

> [cite_start]An opinion that is often heard today is, "C has been already superseded by languages like C++, C#, and Java, so why bother to learn C today?" [cite: 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33]

[cite_start]There are several reasons for this[cite: 31, 37]:
* [cite_start]**Foundation for OOP:** Languages like C++, C#, and Java make use of a principle called Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)[cite: 28, 32, 34, 35, 38, 39]. [cite_start]To use OOP effectively, you need basic programming skills[cite: 44, 45, 46, 47]. [cite_start]Therefore, it makes more sense to first learn C and then move on to C++, C#, or Java[cite: 41, 42, 43, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52].
* [cite_start]**Operating Systems:** Major parts of popular operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux, and Android are written in C[cite: 58, 59]. [cite_start]Device driver programs, which allow the OS to work with new hardware, are written exclusively in C[cite: 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68].
* [cite_start]**Embedded Systems:** Consumer devices like microwave ovens, washing machines, and digital cameras are getting smarter[cite: 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]. [cite_start]This smartness comes from a processor and a program embedded in them[cite: 81, 89]. [cite_start]These programs have to run fast and in limited memory, making C the language of choice for building them[cite: 82, 83, 84, 85, 90, 91, 93, 94, 95].
* [cite_start]**Gaming:** The essence of many computer games is speed[cite: 98, 99]. [cite_start]To react fast to user inputs, the underlying code must be efficient[cite: 100, 101, 102, 103, 107, 108]. [cite_start]That is why popular gaming frameworks are written in C[cite: 104, 105, 106, 109].

### WHICH C ARE WE LEARNING?

There have been several standards for the C language:
* [cite_start]**K&R C:** The original description published in 1978 by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie[cite: 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 121, 131, 132].
* [cite_start]**ANSI C / C89:** In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to standardize C[cite: 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 134, 135, 136]. [cite_start]This standard was completed in 1989 and is often referred to as ANSI C or C89[cite: 137, 138, 139, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149].
* [cite_start]**C95:** In 1995, an extension to the C standard was published, sometimes referred to as C95[cite: 145, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154].
* [cite_start]**C99:** In 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO C standard, which is commonly referred to as C99[cite: 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162].

### STEPS IN LEARNING C LANGUAGE

[cite_start]The basic components of the C language are built up in a sequence[cite: 163, 164, 165, 166]:
1.  [cite_start]**Alphabets, Digits, Special Symbols** [cite: 167, 171]
2.  [cite_start]Combine them to form **Constants, Variables, Keywords** [cite: 168, 169, 172]
3.  [cite_start]Combine them to form **Instructions** [cite: 170]
4.  [cite_start]Combine them to form a **Program** [cite: 173]

### ALPHABETS, DIGITS, AND SPECIAL SYMBOLS

* [cite_start]**Alphabets:** A, B, C, ... Z and a, b, c, ... z [cite: 176]
* [cite_start]**Digits:** 0, 1, 2, ... 9 [cite: 177, 179]
* **Special Symbols:** `~ ! @ # % ^ & * ( ) - _ + = { } [ ] | \ : ; [cite_start]" ' < > , . ? /` [cite: 180, 181]

### CONSTANTS, VARIABLES, AND KEYWORDS

[cite_start]The alphabets, digits, and special symbols, when properly combined, form constants, variables, and keywords[cite: 186].
* [cite_start]A **constant** is an entity that doesn't change[cite: 187, 189, 190, 191, 197]. [cite_start]Constants are also known as *literals*[cite: 202, 203, 204, 205, 206].
* [cite_start]A **variable** is an entity that may change[cite: 192, 193, 194, 195, 196]. [cite_start]Variables are also known as *identifiers*[cite: 207, 208, 209, 210, 211].
* [cite_start]A **keyword** is a word that carries a special meaning to the language compiler[cite: 198, 199, 200].
